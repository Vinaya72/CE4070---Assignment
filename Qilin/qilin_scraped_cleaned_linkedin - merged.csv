Today‚Äôs IT solutions are not only complex and far from user friendly, they are generally created with the principle of the user needing to know the system, rather than the system being tailored to the user. Design refers to how an IT solution is laid out in a usable and friendly way. It is important to recognize how users navigate through applications so as to tune to the user experience. 

Many of today‚Äôs IT solutions are designed in a System-Centric fashion whereby developed systems require the users to understand proprietary complexities, rather than being based on User-Centric designs. We strongly believe that an IT solution‚Äôs success hinges on your ability to use it ‚Äì a system‚Äôs design must understand the requirements of users.

Data is the new oil. We're heading towards a future where data, analytics and smart insights will be the most priced assets of a business, helping them design better products & services, and give them an edge over the competition. This exponential growth in data must be matched with equal advancements in storage techniques, analytics, connectivity, accessibility and  security; all of which can be enabled by cloud computing.

Cloud technology can no longer be marketed as an 'add-on'. Having access to a reliable back-up,  a scalable IT infrastructure and protection against cyberattacks is a requisite for any business that wants to flourish in an increasingly digitized world.  This is where we, WannaGo Cloud, come in.

Spearheaded by our CEO and Founder, Deepak Verma, we recognized the need for businesses to switch from a CAPEX to OPEX environments, with pay-as-you-go options enabling a more flexible, scalable IT Infrastructure.
