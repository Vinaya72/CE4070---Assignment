Today‚Äôs IT solutions are not only complex and far from user friendly, they are generally created with the principle of the user needing to know the system, rather than the system being tailored to the user. Design refers to how an IT solution is laid out in a usable and friendly way. It is important to recognize how users navigate through applications so as to tune to the user experience. 

Many of today‚Äôs IT solutions are designed in a System-Centric fashion whereby developed systems require the users to understand proprietary complexities, rather than being based on User-Centric designs.
