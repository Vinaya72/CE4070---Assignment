This company negotiated with us for more than 3 weeks, company representative asked for more time to deal with us. All 3 weeks they lied to us, while being warned that this would not go away and would eventually affect their customers.
In the notification letter that company publicly announced, they say that are not sure that any personal data of their customers leaked. That is a lie too, as we sent them all proofs and data bases of with personal data of their customers, you can check them here:

Company was notified 02.28.2024, and released info of the breach notice only in a month after that.
As for the data, this company was breach earlier in 2022, all affected customer personal files were simply lying at CCO PC, unprotected, some files were covered with primitive passwords, like river615ù
At the end of negotiations company representative came up with a story that they tried to exchange money, but then lost them, that is another lies. Then they tried to offer us $10,000 to erase all lost data. This company values privacy of their clients for $10,000
All its data available on our website. Also we warned On Q Fin that is negotiations will fail we will spread this data in the dark web. So we will. If you are interested in any specific details or you are working on lawsuits against this company fell free to contact us.
