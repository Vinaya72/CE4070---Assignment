We specialize in User Experience Design consultancy, Enterprise Application Solutions and Mobile Application Development for Small Businesses to Enterprise Corporation that are deployed in N-Tier Architecture Environments.

Todayâs IT solutions are not only complex and far from user friendly, they are generally created with the principle of the user needing to know the system, rather than the system being tailored to the user. Design refers to how an IT solution is laid out in a usable and friendly way. It is important to recognize how users navigate through applications so as to tune to the user experience. 

Many of todayâs IT solutions are designed in a System-Centric fashion whereby developed systems require the users to understand proprietary complexities, rather than being based on User-Centric designs. We strongly believe that an IT solutionâs success hinges on your ability to use it â a systemâs design must understand the requirements of users.

The âvalue addâ in choosing SIMSYS is the rich experience in delivering on time quality Internet Projects to our clients.

eucatex,www.eucatex.com.br,Wholesale Building Materials,"São Paulo, Sp",Brasil,"Eucatex S.A. Indústria e Comércio S.A. (“Eucatex” or the “Company”) was founded in 1951 and since then has been manufacturing and selling ceiling lining and insulating material from eucalyptus fiber. These are low-density products with thermal and acoustic insulation properties, which were largely used in the Brazilian civil construction market. In the beginning of the ‘80s, financial resources generated by its operations since foundation were invested in the implementation of production lines for hardboard (high density wood fiber panels), which still is one of the flagships of the Company.

Currently, Eucatex is the second largest producer of wood fiber panels in the foreign market, with a market share of 41%. In 1996, Eucatex started to manufacture MDP panels and currently has a market share of 16% in this segment in Brazil. In addition, it is the domestic leader in ceiling lining and insulating materials, wall partitions, in addition to operating in the door and flooring markets.

Although Eucatex is traditionally known for its wood-related products, such as wood panels, MDP panels and related products, it also has a manufacturing line entirely integrated for the manufacture of paint (for own consumption and to the market) and resins, expanded vermiculite-based products (used in the manufacturing of wall partitions and ceiling linings with thermal insulating properties) and peat, in addition to galvanized steel roofing sheets and steel profiles. The industrial evolution of Eucatex has always been associated to the growth of its planted forests, which ensures the continuous supply of an important raw material for the company, eucalyptus wood. The Company chiefly operates in the furniture and civil construction industries, and each segment represents 48% and 35% of its income, respectively.","1,001-5,000 employees",14/5/24 4:53,40207,150 GB,"['Intellectual Property', 'Customer and Client Data', 'Databases', 'Legal Documents']",RansomHub
