Banham Poultry is a British poultry producer, based in Attleborough, Norfolk, with an annual turnover of £100 million. Its chairman was Michael Foulger, who was also deputy chairman of Norwich City.

In 2018, the company was put up for sale; a few days later, two pest control contractors were found dead near the Banham site.

The company has more than 1,000 employees. The company was bought by Chesterfield Poultry in October 2018.

In late October 2021, Banham Poultry was bought by the Boparan Private Office, owner of poultry processor 2 Sisters Food Group and Bernard Matthews.

In September 2022, Branham Poultry was fined £300,000 for environmental permit violations after over 300 complaints were made regarding the strong odours of rotting carcasses. The company pleaded guilty to failing to keep activities free from odour levels likely to cause pollution outside the abattoir between January 2019 and September 2021. The judge acknowledged practices at Banham Poultry had a ""significant effect on the quality of life"" in the town.","['Legal Documents', 'Employee and HR Data']",40,"[""Keyword match: 'employee' (Category: Employee and HR Data)"", ""Keyword match: 'contract' (Category: Legal Documents)""]",['No pattern matches'],['No phrase matches']

WARNING!
If you cooperate with CapitalFund1 your personal, insurance and financial data has been stolen! Your money can be stolen at any time!

ATTENTION!
CapitalFund1 is fully aware of the hack and the presence of multiple vulnerabilities in the company. However they have refused all offers to protect their investors' data from being leaked. This company has a $1,000,000 cybercrime insurance policy that could have fully protected the data but the management refused to cooperate and took the proceeds from the insurance company for themselves, framing their clients. We have made hundreds of calls and sent hundreds of letters to the management and staff of CapitalFund1 but they clearly responded that they do not care about the personal and financial data of their clients. We would like to announce the names of those who have expressed such a stance towards their clients and their data and have agreed that we will use all stolen financial, personal and insurance data of investors and clients for criminal purposes:

Michael Anderson - Literally said he didn't care about his clients and their data and hung up on numerous calls and offers from us.
Noah Brocious - Hung up on calls and offers of compromise.
Kevin Highmark - Said it didn't matter to him what happened to the data.
Tyler Larson - Didn't want to talk about it.
Dean Bloxom - Said the most important thing is that the company will get the insurance for this case and that he doesn't care about the customer data.
Buddy Satterfield - Didn't reply even though he read all the emails.
Mike Lofton - Didn't take any action for a month despite all the information.

The rest of the company also ignored and laughed at suggestions to protect investor data. This shows the real attitude of Capitalfund towards its partners and investors. And given that the company stores all data in the open and there are hundreds of vulnerabilities in the network, it will be hacked even more often as we have all access to their network which will be published on many hacker forums.

CapitalFund1 is the most dangerous fund you can choose to cooperate with. By naming multiple vulnerabilities and keeping data in the open CapitalFund1 management tries to attract clients by promising them easy money. However, at any moment all the money, clients' insurance data, clients' personal data and confidential information can be stolen, which we did. Among the stolen data:

- Financial documents
- Personal data of investors and clients
- Confidential information about partners
- SSN and passport data of all clients and employees of the company
- NDA agreements
- Critical information about partners and terms of the transaction
- Accounting documents for many years of the company's operation
- Databases
- Access to various resources of the company and partners of the fund and much more

CapitalFund has fully proven its position as a cobblers in the investment industry and their clients have suffered and will suffer even more in the future. If you are their investor or client and are in their client base, you will be sent a letter of claim against CapitalFund which you can use to win money from them in court. We will also publish other data over time in which every investor will see their confidential data.

Lowe-Martin Group signed a contract with Boxx insurance, hoping that in the event of a cyber attack, the insurance company would support them and compensate for losses. However, as it turned out, the hopes were in vain.

At the beginning of this year, Lowe-Martin Group fell victim to a massive cyber attack. More than 2 TB of confidential client data was stolen, and significant financial damage was inflicted. Lowe-Martin Group immediately notified Boxx insurance of the incident and provided all necessary documents and evidence to receive compensation.

To the deep disappointment of Lowe-Martin Group, Boxx insurance refused to pay compensation. Instead of supporting them in a difficult time, they apparently cited formal reasons and minor technical details in the contract. This refusal left Lowe-Martin Group in a very difficult situation. They found themselves without the financial support needed to recover from the attack and compensate their clients for losses.

We believe that Boxx insurance acted in bad faith and deliberately evaded its obligations. When signing the cyber insurance contract, Lowe-Martin Group expected a reliable partner who would help them in case of unforeseen circumstances. However, instead, they faced indifference and formalism.

The experience of Lowe-Martin Group with Boxx insurance shows that not all insurance companies are willing to fulfill their obligations in full. This case can serve as a warning to other companies considering the possibility of entering into cyber insurance contracts. It is important to carefully study the terms of the contracts and choose only those partners who truly care about their clients.

This incident underscores the importance of transparency and honesty in the insurance business, especially in the face of growing cyber threats. And in conclusion, we warn all current and future clients of Boxx insurance that when you face a similar situation, they will also do everything to leave you to your fate, and we strongly recommend that you change your insurance company.

Below, we provide all the insurance information of Lowe-Martin Group so that you can verify the truth of this matter for yourself.","['Customer and Client Data', 'Legal Documents', 'Employee and HR Data']",60,"[""Keyword match: 'client' (Category: Customer and Client Data)"", ""Keyword match: 'hr' (Category: Employee and HR Data)"", ""Keyword match: 'contract' (Category: Legal Documents)""]",['No pattern matches'],['No phrase matches']

Sicoob's management has 72 hours to contact us and protect their business and their customers' data.
If they contact us within that time, we will apply additional actions:

- Stolen customer and partner data will be made publicly available and used for criminal purposes.
- Repeated attacks will be launched against various bank structures. No amount of protection will prevent this because we are already deep inside the company.
- We will sell valuable infrastructure information about the bank and provide remote access to interested parties.
- We will publish the entire internal infrastructure of the bank with all access and passwords
- The bank's ATMs and customers' money will be at risk of hacking and theft 24/7

We combine quality, practicality, healthiness and sophisticated ingredients. We are constantly searching for foods and wines of excellence in flavor and origin to bring a true gourmet experience to Brazilians' tables. Research, discover, test and select are the pillars of our curation.

Offer your own brand products in addition to iconic international gastronomy brands. All of this makes La Pastina a unique company, a true curator of extraordinary flavors, an ambassador of Italian and Mediterranean cuisine in Brazil.

We provide a complete experience, bringing to Brazil products from more than 16 countries, more than 250 wines, observed labels produced in the main wine growing regions of the world, such as Argentina, Chile, United States, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal.
