Banham Poultry is a British poultry producer, based in Attleborough, Norfolk, with an annual turnover of £100 million. Its chairman was Michael Foulger, who was also deputy chairman of Norwich City.

In 2018, the company was put up for sale; a few days later, two pest control contractors were found dead near the Banham site.

The company has more than 1,000 employees. The company was bought by Chesterfield Poultry in October 2018.

In late October 2021, Banham Poultry was bought by the Boparan Private Office, owner of poultry processor 2 Sisters Food Group and Bernard Matthews.

In September 2022, Branham Poultry was fined £300,000 for environmental permit violations after over 300 complaints were made regarding the strong odours of rotting carcasses. The company pleaded guilty to failing to keep activities free from odour levels likely to cause pollution outside the abattoir between January 2019 and September 2021. The judge acknowledged practices at Banham Poultry had a ""significant effect on the quality of life"" in the town."

WARNING!
If you cooperate with CapitalFund1 your personal, insurance and financial data has been stolen! Your money can be stolen at any time!

ATTENTION!
CapitalFund1 is fully aware of the hack and the presence of multiple vulnerabilities in the company. However they have refused all offers to protect their investors' data from being leaked. This company has a $1,000,000 cybercrime insurance policy that could have fully protected the data but the management refused to cooperate and took the proceeds from the insurance company for themselves, framing their clients. We have made hundreds of calls and sent hundreds of letters to the management and staff of CapitalFund1 but they clearly responded that they do not care about the personal and financial data of their clients. We would like to announce the names of those who have expressed such a stance towards their clients and their data and have agreed that we will use all stolen financial, personal and insurance data of investors and clients for criminal purposes:

Michael Anderson - Literally said he didn't care about his clients and their data and hung up on numerous calls and offers from us.
Noah Brocious - Hung up on calls and offers of compromise.
Kevin Highmark - Said it didn't matter to him what happened to the data.
Tyler Larson - Didn't want to talk about it.
Dean Bloxom - Said the most important thing is that the company will get the insurance for this case and that he doesn't care about the customer data.
Buddy Satterfield - Didn't reply even though he read all the emails.
Mike Lofton - Didn't take any action for a month despite all the information.

The rest of the company also ignored and laughed at suggestions to protect investor data. This shows the real attitude of Capitalfund towards its partners and investors. And given that the company stores all data in the open and there are hundreds of vulnerabilities in the network, it will be hacked even more often as we have all access to their network which will be published on many hacker forums.

CapitalFund1 is the most dangerous fund you can choose to cooperate with. By naming multiple vulnerabilities and keeping data in the open CapitalFund1 management tries to attract clients by promising them easy money. However, at any moment all the money, clients' insurance data, clients' personal data and confidential information can be stolen, which we did. Among the stolen data:

- Financial documents
- Personal data of investors and clients
- Confidential information about partners
- SSN and passport data of all clients and employees of the company
- NDA agreements
- Critical information about partners and terms of the transaction
- Accounting documents for many years of the company's operation
- Databases
- Access to various resources of the company and partners of the fund and much more

CapitalFund has fully proven its position as a cobblers in the investment industry and their clients have suffered and will suffer even more in the future. If you are their investor or client and are in their client base, you will be sent a letter of claim against CapitalFund which you can use to win money from them in court. We will also publish other data over time in which every investor will see their confidential data.

Lowe-Martin Group signed a contract with Boxx insurance, hoping that in the event of a cyber attack, the insurance company would support them and compensate for losses. However, as it turned out, the hopes were in vain.

At the beginning of this year, Lowe-Martin Group fell victim to a massive cyber attack. More than 2 TB of confidential client data was stolen, and significant financial damage was inflicted. Lowe-Martin Group immediately notified Boxx insurance of the incident and provided all necessary documents and evidence to receive compensation.

To the deep disappointment of Lowe-Martin Group, Boxx insurance refused to pay compensation. Instead of supporting them in a difficult time, they apparently cited formal reasons and minor technical details in the contract. This refusal left Lowe-Martin Group in a very difficult situation. They found themselves without the financial support needed to recover from the attack and compensate their clients for losses.

We believe that Boxx insurance acted in bad faith and deliberately evaded its obligations. When signing the cyber insurance contract, Lowe-Martin Group expected a reliable partner who would help them in case of unforeseen circumstances. However, instead, they faced indifference and formalism.

The experience of Lowe-Martin Group with Boxx insurance shows that not all insurance companies are willing to fulfill their obligations in full. This case can serve as a warning to other companies considering the possibility of entering into cyber insurance contracts. It is important to carefully study the terms of the contracts and choose only those partners who truly care about their clients.

This incident underscores the importance of transparency and honesty in the insurance business, especially in the face of growing cyber threats. And in conclusion, we warn all current and future clients of Boxx insurance that when you face a similar situation, they will also do everything to leave you to your fate, and we strongly recommend that you change your insurance company.

Below, we provide all the insurance information of Lowe-Martin Group so that you can verify the truth of this matter for yourself."

He started out of his garage and was the first seamless gutter installation company in the Peoria area. After a few years, the business outgrew his garage and in 1970, he purchased both an office building and a facility to start manufacturing a few products as an added branch to his installation company. By 1972, he expanded again by purchasing one large building for both the office and manufacturing plant. In 1973 he disbanded the installation side of the company, purchased a second manufacturing building, and Lynch Aluminum Mfg was born! A third building was purchased in 1974 to further expand the company. In 1982 our current location totaling 120,000 square feet was purchased and our offices, manufacturing, and warehouse were all moved into one location. In 2020, we purchased an additional warehouse totaling 80,000 square feet to provide us with a larger capacity to meet our customers growing needs for more products and colors. This brings us up to over 200,000 square feet of space in which to manufacture and distribute our ever-increasing product line here in the Peoria area.

Due to multiple vulnerabilities several divisions of Eni Company have been hacked. 
Stolen data such as:

- Financial and banking documents
- Passport and insurance data
- Geological reports and forecasts
- Details of oil production in different regions
- Detailed engineering information about the company's facilities
- Secret correspondence
- NDA documents
- Contracts and amounts of supplies of various raw materials
- Classified information on company tenders
- Internal correspondence of company employees and clients
- Detailed maps of resource extraction and engineering structures for their extraction by different time slices

We stole all the confidential data of the company and its partners. They are already being used for criminal purposes against ENI partners and management. The remaining confidential documents are already available for download.

ENI management in Libya, Italy and the UK have refused to protect the confidential data of their partners saying that they don't care what happens to this data and that they don't care what happens to their partners as they will only cooperate with them anyway. We advise all ENI partners to terminate their contracts and not to risk their security. Due to the huge number of vulnerabilities in the entire ENI network, any partners can be attacked at any minute.

The network administrator in the Libya office deserves special attention. First, he tried to hide the hack from the company's management, and then he obstructed defense negotiations in every possible way. By his actions, he caused ENI great damage and proved his failure as a professional. Such characters should work in a circus not in oil companies. 

Enjoy the data and wait for further publication of ENI's confidential data as they still claim there was no hack - this allows them to steal everything they have.

Clevo computer manufacturing company is a Taiwanese OEM/ODM computer manufacturer that produces laptop computers. They sell barebones laptop chassis to value-added resellers who build customized laptops for individual customers

Some of their partners:
- MSI
- Gigabyte
- Asus
And the list goes on

Their main partners are:
- AMD
- Intel
- Nvidia
- Micron

All network and backups are fully ecnrypted. We took care of it. The company has no chance to recover. Only our decryptor will help them to get back to work, nothing else will help them.

We have been in the company's network for a long time. We have done an analysis of their products, clients and partners. And of course we downloaded the most important and sensitive data with file formats such as :

pdf,pptx,ppt,dwg,dxf,prt,sldprt,asm,sldasm,sdcpc,sdac,sdcc,sdwc,doc,dwt,dws,prt,sdp.

The publication of these documents may cause the termination of contracts with their partners due to violation of non disclosure agreements.

We tried to find a peaceful solution to solve this problem. They visited the landing page, read message and were also informed by calls.

A certain employee whose name is “SEN” (SEN_SHU@CLEVO.COM.TW) took calls as a joke and began to laugh at words that the clients’ data would go public.

Congratulations Sen, you are the star, because of clowns like you companies are being destroyed.

We hope that the owners of the company will make the only right decision and start negotiations.

You still have time and opportunity to contact us and solve everything for a little money. We are waiting in the chat.  We don’t want your company to collapse, your partners to sue you for NDA vialotion and the drawings and product developments to be sold to competitors. Our step will be exactly this if you don't get in touch.

We've been on your police station's network for a long time. 
We have had time to analyze all your data and find a lot of interesting things.
I would like to remind you that we have stolen 1.1+TB of your confidential data.
If you don't contact us immediately, we will reveal to the world your approach to work, unsolved criminal cases, deaths of prisoners in cells, rapes and very, very interesting and sensational files.
The case will have a huge resonance in the world media and no censorship will help you.
If you cannot protect yourself, how can you guarantee the protection of citizens and society?
Many people will suffer from this leak. Let's not let this happen!
We propose an agreement.
We are apolitical and we are only interested in the business side of the issue.
We look forward to your chat.


UPD: 
You have three days left. We're ready to publish a lot of great stuff.

After we got all the necessary keys to clean up the backups we also found out that the keys belonged to CYNC Solutions, namely to the director - JOSEPH RODERICK. After a bit of digging through the storage we were able to easily access the main repository of the IT company, which is just engaged in providing Disaster Recovery Backup solutions.

Well, at this point we already had full access to the backups of every CYNC Solutions client, which gave us the ability to offload them without much difficulty. We took over the data of third-party companies and drop the reputation of this IT company to zero.

Once again, on the front end - a regular real estate office in the states; on the back end - data from a dozen companies that didn't even know about the leak. How? IT guys who only care about money and don't care about the security and privacy of their customers' data. THAT'S YOUR DAY JOB, DUDES! You're screwed.

All proofs as well as critical company data will be published no later than 04/23/2024. In order to prevent mass leaks of your customers' data, we advise you to contact us via chat, the link to which you will find in your mailboxes.

Instead of paying us, you are choosing to rebuild which is going to take longer than decrypting your network would. Why not tell truth to customers who money you have sitting there, and tell them your security sucks and you sorry.

We think about the transformative power of good food. For more than 70 years we have discovered that a selection of good ingredients when preparing a meal enriches the food and transforms the conventional into celebrations. Make everything good even better.

We have a true passion for Mediterranean wine gastronomy and dedicate ourselves fully to it. For us, the rite of food is a key element of life, it is where we share thoughts and live relationships.

We combine quality, practicality, healthiness and sophisticated ingredients. We are constantly searching for foods and wines of excellence in flavor and origin to bring a true gourmet experience to Brazilians' tables. Research, discover, test and select are the pillars of our curation.

Offer your own brand products in addition to iconic international gastronomy brands. All of this makes La Pastina a unique company, a true curator of extraordinary flavors, an ambassador of Italian and Mediterranean cuisine in Brazil.

We provide a complete experience, bringing to Brazil products from more than 16 countries, more than 250 wines, observed labels produced in the main wine growing regions of the world, such as Argentina, Chile, United States, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. As for the food line, it is an invitation to an imaginary Mediterranean: from fish from the Adriatic Sea to olive oils from Sicily, you will find a world of colors, flavors and aromas."
